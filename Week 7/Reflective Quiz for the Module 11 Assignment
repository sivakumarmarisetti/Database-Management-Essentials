Question 1
For each error on problem 1 (initial ERD), indicate the error type, a brief description of the error, and lessons learned or insights from the error. If you did not make any errors, indicate that your solution satisfied the assignment requirements.

Insertion anomaly: patients, providers, and visits cannot be entered alone. VisitNo and
ProvNo must be entered for each row because they are the primary key. For example, to
insert a new patient P5, a visit number and provider number must be provided.
• Update anomaly: Multiple rows may be needed to be changed to update patient zipcode,
visit date, patient city, provider specialty, provider email, and patient age. For example to
update the age of patient P1, two rows must be updated.
• Deletion anomaly: deleting a row can inadvertently cause deletion of a patient, visit,
provider, and zip code if any of these entities are associated with just a single diagnosis
(combination of visit and provider). For example, if row 3 is deleted, details about patient
P3 and visit V93030 are lost.
Correct
Provide details from your evaluation of problem 1 (initial ERD) using the grading rubric.

Question 2
For each error on problem 2 (revised ERD), indicate the error type, a brief description of the error, and lessons learned or insights from the error. If you did not make any errors, indicate that your solution satisfied the assignment requirements.

VisitNo → PatNo
VisitNo, ProvNo → Diagnosis
ProvNo → ProvEmail
ProvEmail → ProvNo
Correct
Provide details from your evaluation of problem 2 (revised ERD) using the grading rubric.

Question 3
For each error on problem 3, indicate the error type, a brief description of the error, and lessons learned or insights from the error. If you did not make any errors, indicate that your solution satisfied the assignment requirements.

LenderName, InstName, and StdEmail are determinants. The Student, Lender, and Institution
tables are in BCNF because these determinants are unique. The tables should not be split
because they are in BCNF. Unique constraints should be added for LenderName, InstName,
and StdEmail. Here is the revised table design with the unique constraints.
Student (StdNo, StdName, StdEmail, StdAddress, StdCity, StdState, StdZip )
UNIQUE (StdEmail)
Lender(LenderNo, LenderName)
UNIQUE (LenderName)
Institution(InstNo, InstName, InstMascot)
UNIQUE (InstName)
Correct
Provide details from your evaluation of problem 3 using the grading rubric.

Question 4
For each error on problem 4, indicate the error type, a brief description of the error, and lessons learned or insights from the error. If you did not make any errors, indicate that your solution satisfied the assignment requirements.

OrdNo FDs and sample data that violates the FDs. The rows refer to the sample rows above.
Only 1 falsification per FD is necessary to identify.
