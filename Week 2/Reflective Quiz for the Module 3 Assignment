Question 1
For each error on the Employee table, indicate the error type, a brief description of the error, and lessons learned or insights from the error. If you did not make any errors, indicate that your solution satisfied the assignment requirements.
Medium, 4 NOT NULL constraints required. NOT NULL
constraint for the primary key is optional, Missing a NOT NULL
constraint
Major, EmpNo; Inline or external, Missing primary key
constraint
Minor, All constraints should have a name, Missing a constraint name
Medium, See solution for data types, Incorrect data type
Minor, Length should be 8 for EmpNo; Length for
other columns may vary if wide enough for
values, Incorrect length specification
Question 2
For each error on the ResourceTbl table, indicate the error type, a brief description of the error, and lessons learned or insights from the error. If you did not make any errors, indicate that your solution satisfied the assignment requirements.
Missing a NOT NULL
constraint
Medium 2 NOT NULL constraints required. NOT NULL
constraint for the primary key is optional.
Missing primary key
constraint
Major ResNo; Inline or external
Missing a constraint name Minor All constraints should have a name.
Incorrect data type Medium See solution for data types
Incorrect length specification Minor Length should be 8 for ResNo; Length for other
columns may vary as long as wide enough for
values.
Missing CHECK constraint Medium Rate should have CHECK constraint inline or
external
Incorrect CHECK constraint Minor See solution for constraint details
Question 3
For each error on the EventRequest table, indicate the error type, a brief description of the error, and lessons learned or insights from the error. If you did not make any errors, indicate that your solution satisfied the assignment requirements.
Missing a NOT NULL
constraint
Medium 7 NOT NULL constraints required. NOT NULL
constraint for the primary key is optional.
Should not have NOT NULL constraints for
other columns
Missing primary key
constraint
Major EventNo; Inline or external
Missing a constraint name Minor All constraints should have a name.
Incorrect data type Medium See solution for data types
Incorrect length specification Minor Length should be 8 for EventNo, CustNo, and
FacNo; Length for other columns may vary as
long as wide enough for values.
Missing CHECK constraint Medium Status and EstAudience should have CHECK
constraints inline or external
Incorrect CHECK constraint Minor See solution for constraint details
Missing or incorrect foreign
key constraints
Medium Should have 2 foreign key constraints; See
solution for constraint details
Question 4
For each error on the EventPlan table, indicate the error type, a brief description of the error, and lessons learned or insights from the error. If you did not make any errors, indicate that your solution satisfied the assignment requirements.
Missing a NOT NULL
constraint
Medium 3 NOT NULL constraints required. NOT NULL
constraint for the primary key is optional.
Should not have NOT NULL constraints for
other columns especially EmpNo
Missing primary key
constraint
Major PlanNo; Inline or external
Missing a constraint name Minor All constraints should have a name.
Incorrect data type Medium See solution for data types
Incorrect length specification Minor Length should be 8 for PlanNo, EventNo, and
EmpNo; Length for other columns may vary as
long as wide enough for values.
Missing or incorrect foreign
key constraints
Medium Should have 2 foreign key constraints; See
solution for constraint details
